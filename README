# Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes.
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various clinical features.
The model is built using a structured dataset and employs thorough preprocessing techniques to optimize performance.
To ensure a reliable and unbiased evaluation, stratified K-fold cross-validation is utilized, allowing for consistent assessment across different subsets of the data. 
The objective is to demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods in supporting clinical decision-making and enhancing the early diagnosis of heart conditions.
